Small server (21k jar size) that is happy with a 6M heap and stays
under 100MB resident set size after handling 50,000 requests (at a
rate of 13k req/sec) (for one toy hello world handler).

Uses Sun's original HTTP server (com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer)
which made it into the official Java 9 module list and Oracle appears
to be maintaining.

	To run tests		make test
	To build    		make

After building, the module is mlib.

See the hello world module for an example for how to use the server.
