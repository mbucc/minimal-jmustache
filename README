Small server (21k jar size) that is happy with a 3M heap and stays under 120MB
resident set size when handling 50,000 requests for one toy hello world handler.
See docs/memtest_UseSerialGC_3m.txt for ApacheBench and memory usage details.

Uses Sun's original HTTP server (com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer) which made
it into the official Java 9 module list and Oracle appears to be maintaining.

	To run tests		make test
	To build    		make

After building, the modules are in mlib.

Note that the console logger is System.Logger implementation that logs to INFO
and DEBUG to stdout and ERROR to stderr.  For more info on how Java sources use
System.Logger, see docs/DIG-jdk-logging-levels.txt.

See the hello world module for an example for how to use the server.
